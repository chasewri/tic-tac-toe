## Description
I was able to practice several different types of array
manipulation, as well as creating an array of object values. Hopefully the CSS gets better before you read this!

```js
- for ... in obj
- arr.splice()
- arr.push()
- arr.reduce()
```
## Technologies
- HTML
- Poorly written CSS
- Skeleton CSS
- JavaScript
